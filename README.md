DESCIRPTION

DESCRIPTION: React Native, a framework for creating mobile apps with JavaScript and React, is used to write the code.
A default export is defined for the App component. It functions as my app's entry point. 
A View component with the style specified by the styles.container object resides inside the App component.
I changed the View's backdrop color to a tomato red  tint, #ff6347.
The text "My name is" is displayed in the Text component after my bolded name, YAA ASIEDUA AMPOFO. 
Included with the component is the StatusBar, whose style is set to "auto," meaning it adjusts to the status bar appearance of the platform.
